					<b>Safe And Sound</b>
</div>
<pre>
I remember tears streaming 
down your face
When I said, 
I'll never let you go
When all those shadows 
almost killed your light
I remember you said, 
Don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and 
gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling everything's on fire
The war outside our 
door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone. 
Gone.
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oohhh.
