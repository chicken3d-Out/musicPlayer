					<b>Back To December</b>
</div>
<pre>
I'm so glad you made time to see me 
How's life, tell me, how's your family 
I haven't seem them in a while 
You've been good, busier than ever 
W'll small talk, 
working the weather 
Your guard is up and I know why 
Cause the last time you saw me 
Is still burned in the back of your mind 
You gave me roses and 
I left them there to die 
So this is me swallowing my pride, 
standing in front of you 
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to 
December all the time 
It turns out freedom 
aint nothing but missing you    
Wishing I realized 
what i had when you were  mine
I go back to December, 
turn around and make it alright 
I go back to December all the time 
These days I haven't been sleeping 
Staying up, playing back myself leaving 
When your birthday passed and 
I didn't call 
Then I think about summer,
all the beautiful times 
I watched you laughing 
from the passenger side 
And realized I loved you in the fall
And when the cold came, the dark days 
When fear crept into my mind 
You gave me all your love 
and all I gave you was goodbye 
So this is me swallowing my pride, 
standing in front of you
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December all the time 
It turns out freedom made 
nothing but missing you 
Wishing that I'd realized what 
I had when you were mine
I go back to December, 
turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time 
I miss your tan skin and your sweet smile
So good to me, so right 
And how you held me in your arms
 that September night 
The first time you ever saw me cry 
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming 
But if we loved again, 
I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, 
but I can't So if the chain is on your door, 
I understand 
But this is me swallowing my pride, 
standing in front of you 
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December 
It turns out freedom made 
nothing but missing you 
Wishing that I'd realized what 
I had when you were mine 
I go back to December, 
turn around and make it alright 
I go back to December, 
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time 
All the time
