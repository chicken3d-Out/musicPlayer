					<b>Everything Has Changed</b>
</div>
<pre>
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now 
I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago 
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile in
The back of my mind making me feel right
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know,
you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello 
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, 
is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take them down, take them down 
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time 
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, 
everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, 
is everything has changed Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Ahhh And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just want to know you better know, 
you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, 
everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, 
is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found brightness
All my days, I'll know your face
