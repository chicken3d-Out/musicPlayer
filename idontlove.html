					<b>I Don't Love You</b>
</div>
<pre>
Well when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way
When after all this time that you still owe
You're still, 
the good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did Yesterday"
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out 
It's where you oughta stay 
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can Whoa, whooa
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday"
Well come on, come on
Would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday"
