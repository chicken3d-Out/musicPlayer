					<b>Where Have You Been My Disco?</b>
</div>
<pre>
Your momma said that you should be home
Seven in the evening with a sober soul
Don't you worry, brother
I am on my way
Just keep on trucking tonight
Children of the future, let me tell you something
Boogie is my life that I've never shown it
Why have you forsaken all the things we know?
I wanna show it tonight
They don't need no disco, no disco
Where have you been, my disco, my disco?
Take me back to disco, to disco
Groove it up
Groove it up
Darling, it's coming back
Loving you
Revive the old
Make it new
Come on, it's going down
Make it true
Celebrate
Celebrate
Your momma said that you should be gone
Don't you dare to come back with a pretty bad face
Take it easy, brother
I am here to stay
Just keep on dancing 'til the girls are gone (girls are gone)
Children of the future, let me tell you something
Boogie is my life since when I was young
I've been livin' heaven, leaving all the pain
I wanna show it tonight
They don't need no disco, no disco
Where have you been, my disco, my disco?
Take me back to disco, to disco
Groove it up
Groove it up
Darling, it's coming back
Loving you
Revive the old
Make it new
Come on, it's going down
Make it true
Celebrate
Celebrate
Coming back
Loving you
Revive the old
Make it new
Come on, it's going down
Make it true
Celebrate
Celebrate
Where have you been, my disco?
Where have you been, my disco?
Where have you been, my disco?
Darling, it's coming back
Loving you
Revive the old
Make it new
Come on, it's going down
Make it true
Celebrate
Celebrate
Darling, it's coming back
Loving you (where have you been, my disco)
Revive the old
Make it new (where have you been, my disco)
Come on, it's going down
Make it true (where have you been, my disco)
Celebrate
Celebrate
