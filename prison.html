					<b>In My Prison</b>
</div>
<pre>
Help me
Something is a misery
Save me
Somebody wants to take me
Kill me
So I have a reason to live
Take me
So I have a reason to give
I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh!
Faster
Cars are slowly moving
Shining
Like a dream that we are facing
I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh!
I'm in my prison
And I am the only prey
You are the reason
Why my heart and soul would stay
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh!
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't forget it on my mind
I can't remember
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
I'm in the middle of the night
I won't be coming home tonight, oh!
