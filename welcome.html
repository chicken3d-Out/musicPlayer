					<b>Welcome To The Black Parade</b>
</div>
<pre>
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten, and the damned?
He said, will you defeat them
Your demons and all the non-believers?
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, son, when you grow up
You will be the savior of the broken
The beaten, and the damned?
Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all
The rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black
And take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end
We hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on, we carry through the fears
(Oh, oh, oh)
