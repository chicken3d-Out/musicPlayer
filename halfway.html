					<b>Halfway Right</b>
</div>
<pre>
I scream at myself when there's 
nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, 
if I'm wrong, 
then I'm halfway right
Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows live
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an an empty vow
Couldn't remember where 
I've been that night
I knew that I took it too far
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone
I scream at myself when 
there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, 
then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, 
but It feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, 
if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
Told me kid you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, 
you know you'll never last
It was bullshit then, 
I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone
I scream at myself when 
there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, 
if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, 
but It feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right, 
halfway right
I scream at myself when 
there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, 
then I'm halfway right
I scream at myself when 
there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, 
then I'm halfway right
