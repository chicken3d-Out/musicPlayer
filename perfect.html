					<b>Perfect</b>
</div>
<pre>
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, 
and follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the 
someone waiting for me
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, 
I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, 
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you’re holding mine
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, 
listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, 
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, 
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, 
I hope that someday I’ll share her home
I found a love, 
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, 
to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we’re so in love, 
fighting against all odds
I know that we’ll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand, 
be my girl, I’ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, 
listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, 
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, 
darling you look perfect tonight
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, 
listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see, 
now I know I have met an angel
In person, and she looks perfect tonight
No I don't deserve it, 
you look perfect tonight
