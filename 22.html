<pre>
It feels like a perfect night, 
to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, 
uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night, 
for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, 
uh uh, uh uh
Yeaaaah
We're happy, free, 
confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we 
forget about the deadlines 
It's time, uh u
I don't know about you, 
but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if, 
you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if, 
we just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two, twenty-two
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded 
Too many cool kids, uh uh uh uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene 
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
We're happy, free, confused and 
lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we 
forget about the heartbreaks 
It's time, uh uh
I don't know about you, 
but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if, 
you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, 
but I bet you want to Everything will be alright if,
we just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two, twenty-two
I don't know about you, twenty-two, 
twenty-two
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news 
I gotta have you, 
I gotta have you
