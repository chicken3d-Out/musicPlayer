					<b>Chlorine</b>
</div>
<pre>
Sippin' on straight chlorine, 
let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, 
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, 
moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue
Dependant at times
Poisonous vibration
Help my body run
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Sippin' on straight chlorine, 
let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, 
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
 Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
Had you in my coat pocket, 
where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, 
you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, 
my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read 
incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight 
and you in my life is like 
Sippin' on straight chlorine,  
let the vibes slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, 
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical 
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibeMoment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the end of
A weathered flag that's by the sea 
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
