					<b>Stressed Out</b>
</div>
<pre>
I wish I found some better sounds 
no one’s ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that 
sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords 
in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,
I was told when I get older 
all my fears would shrink,
But now I’m insecure and 
I care what people think.
My name's Blurryface and 
I care what you think.
My name's Blurryface and 
I care what you think.
Wish we could turn back time, 
to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep 
but now we’re stressed out.
Wish we could turn back time, 
to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep 
but now we’re stressed out.
We're stressed out.
Sometimes a certain smell will 
take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to 
identify where it’s coming from,
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, 
I’d probably only sell one,
It’d be to my brother, ‘
cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s 
throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when 
nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse 
homes we all would take the latter.
My-My-My name's Blurryface and 
I care what you think.
My name's Blurryface and 
I care what you think.
Wish we could turn back time, 
to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep 
but now we’re stressed out.
Wish we could turn back time, 
to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep 
but now we’re stressed out.
We used to play pretend, 
give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and 
then we’d fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now 
they’re laughing at our face,
Saying, "wake up, 
you need to make money." Yeah.

Used to play pretend, 
used to play pretend, honey
We used to play pretend, wake up, 
you need the money
Used to play pretend, 
used to play pretend, honey
We used to play pretend, wake up, 
you need the money
Used to play pretend, 
give each other different names
