					<b>Love Story</b>
</div>
<pre>
We   were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony of summer air.
See the lights, 
See the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello;
Little did I know
Refrain
That you were Romeo;
 you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, 
"Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, 
'Please don't go....And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and 
I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say...yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you. 
We keep quite 
'cause we're dead if they know.
So close your eyes;
Escape this town for a little while.
Cause you were Romeo, 
I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said "
Stay away from Juliet,"
But you were everything to me;
I was begging you, 
Please, don't go...And I said,
</pre>
