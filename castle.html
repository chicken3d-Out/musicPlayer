					<b>Castle On The Hill</b>
</div>
<pre>
When I was 6 years old 
I broke my leg
I was runnig from my brother
And his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume
Of the montain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when
I found my heart 
And broke it here
Made friends and lost them
Through the years
And I've not seen
The roaring fields, In so long
I know, I've grown
I can't wait to go home 
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90
Down those 
Country lanes 
Singing to tiny dancer 
And I miss the way
You make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset 
Over the castle on the hill
15 years old smoking handrolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields
And getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a friday night
I don't reckon, I dit it right
I was yourger then
Take me back to when
We found, weekend jobs
When we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up
In so long, oh how we've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way 
Driving at 90
Down those 
Country lanes 
Singing to tiny dancer 
And I miss the way
You make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset 
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me, and I
Can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
I still remember 
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way You make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset 
Over the castle on the hill 
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
