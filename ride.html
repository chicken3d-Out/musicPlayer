<pre>
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
 I know it’s hard sometimes
 Pieces of peace in the 
sun’s peace of mind
 I know it’s hard sometimes
 Yeah I think about the 
end just way too much
 But it’s fun to fantasize
 On my enemies 
I wouldn’t wish who I was
 But it’s fun to fantasize
Oh Oh whoa, 
oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so 
I’m taking my time on my ride
Oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride 
I'm taking my time on my ride
die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people 
that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room 
But I don't seem to see many 
bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you 
know it's not true
Even harder to write when 
you know that tonight 
There were people back home 
who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they’re for real
Like who would you live for? 
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
Oh Oh whoa, oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
Oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride 
I'm taking my time on my ride
 I’ve been thinking too much
I’ve been thinking too much
I’ve been thinking too much
I’ve been thinking too much
Help me
I’ve been thinking too much 
I’ve been thinking too much 
I’ve been thinking too much 
I’ve been thinking too much
Oh Oh whoa, oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride
Oh Oh whoa
I’m falling so I’m taking my time
I'm taking my time on my ride
Whoa, yeah
Oh Oh Whoa, Oh Oh Whoa,
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh Oh Whoa
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my 
I’ve been thinking too much, Help me
I’ve been thinking too much  Help me
I've been thinking too much 
(I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much 
(Help me)
I've been thinking too much 
(I've been thinking too much)
(Help me)
