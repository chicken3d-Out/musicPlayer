					<b>Iridescent</b>
</div>
<pre>
When you were standing 
in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting 
on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down, 
insides crying save me now
You were there impossibly alone
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go
And in the burst of light 
that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown 
the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of temper 
grace falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but 
failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go
Do you feel cold and 
lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness 
and frustration
And let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go
